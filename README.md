- We are drafting a more detailed README in the
  [README](https://github.com/kelvinguu/neural-editor/tree/readme) branch (see here for dataset links)
- This is research code meant to serve as a reference implementation. We do not
  recommend heavily extending or modifying this codebase for other purposes.

If you have questions, please email Kelvin at `guu.kelvin` at `gmail.com`.
